## Part A: existing  technology
### software
*  National Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP) Data Visualization Tool
   *  This wedcite talks about you can viwe diffent coral rife from the Americas
* https://chei.ucsd.edu/the-software-thats-saving-corals/
  * This talk about Viscore
    *   The software translates thousands of underwater photographs and videos into detailed, high-resolution 3D maps of the reef
    *   Researchers can "virtually" revisit dive sites and use the software to perform detailed analyses that would be time-consuming or impossible in person
* https://hcas.nova.edu/tools-and-resources/cpce/index.html
  * This talk abuot CPCe (Coral Point Count with Excel extensions)
    * CPCe is a Windows-based program that uses a "random point count" method to analyze photos of coral reefs to determine coral cover.
* https://hcas.nova.edu/tools-and-resources/coralxds/index.html
  * This talks about CoralXDS (Coral X-radiograph Densitometry System)
    * CoralXDS is a Windows program that analyzes coral X-ray images to measure growth by examining high-density, low-density, and annual bands.
       
  
  ### technology
* Talking a digital dive: a new global survey gets the best look yet at the world's imperiled coral reefs
* The Shift to a Bird's-Eye View: Remote sensing technologies allow researchers to track small changes on a large scale and enable studies of far-flung places from the comfort and safety of home.
  * This link talk about remote sensing and how this can help to observe calres ecositem to keep progers
 * https://www.barrierreef.org/news/news/five-spawning-technologies
   * This artical talka about 5 differnt techology that help corel but i will only use Nanny cams
    * Nanny cams
     * Remote monitoring: The cameras use artificial intelligence (AI) to remotely track the growth and survival of coral larvae and babies in tanks and nurseries.

    * this talk about CPCe(Coral Point Count with Excel Extensions)
       * CPCe, which stands for Coral Point Count with Excel Extensions, is a free software program used to analyze coral reef health by determining the percentage of coral and              other substrates in underwater photographs

 * https://www.barrierreef.org/news/explainers/what-is-cloud-brightening
   * cloud brightening
     * Cloud brightening helps coral reefs by creating brighter, more reflective clouds that shade the ocean and lower water temperatures, which in turn reduces the stress on corals       from marine heatwaves

* Robotic coral reef repair uses robots to automate and scale up the process of restoring damaged reefs
