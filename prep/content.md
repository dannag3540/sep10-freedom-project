  * Taking a digital dive: a new global survey gets the best look yet at the world's imperiled coral reefs
* The Shift to a Bird's-Eye View: Remote sensing technologies allow researchers to track small changes on a large scale and enable studies of far-flung places from the comfort and safety of home.
  * This link talk about remote sensing and how this can help to observe calres ecositem to keep progers

   * This artical talka about 5 differnt techology that help corel but i will only use Nanny cams
    * Nanny cams
     * Remote monitoring: The cameras use artificial intelligence (AI) to remotely track the growth and survival of coral larvae and babies in tanks and nurseries.

    * this talk about CPCe(Coral Point Count with Excel Extensions)
       * CPCe, which stands for Coral Point Count with Excel Extensions, is a free software program used to analyze coral reef health by determining the percentage of coral and              other substrates in underwater photographs

   * cloud brightening
     * Cloud brightening helps coral reefs by creating brighter, more reflective clouds that shade the ocean and lower water temperatures, which in turn reduces the stress on corals       from marine heatwaves
