 ##  context 
 In my reserche of software and hardware technologies I came up with meny diffent thing and chalnges because I had provem for the software part and how to find the rasorse I needer. I well first talk about the tehnologies I found. Buring my reserche I came accrose menny intresing software and technologie I never thout exsitde.In this blog I will de sumarising every thigh I found and learnde.

 ### Software
  For the software I found **NCRMP** or **National Coral Reef Monitoring Program**. NCRMP is a wedsite that allows users to see corals development over years around the world here is the link (https://ncrmp.coralreef.noaa.gov/). An other sofware I found was **Viscore** this software program tack underwater picher and videos of corels and make it into 3D high-resolution map of reef. with viscore researchers can "virtually" revisit dive sites and use the software to perform detailed analyses that would be time-consuming or impossible in person I found all this informaton on (https://chei.ucsd.edu/the-software-thats-saving-corals/). Up next is **CPCe** or also knew as **Coral Point Count with Excel extensions**. This software is a Windows-based program that uses a "random point count" method to analyze photos of coral reefs to determine coral cover in other words this analyzes corals and then puts the corals development into graphs more information in link (https://hcas.nova.edu/tools-and-resources/cpce/index.html). Lastly we have **CoralXDS** or **Coral X-radiograph Densitometry System**. CoralXDS is a Windows program that analyzes coral X-ray images to measure growth by examining high-density, low-density, and annual bands link i use was https://hcas.nova.edu/tools-and-resources/coralxds/index.html.
