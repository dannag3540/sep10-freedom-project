## content: resherch about part A of my Sep10-project 
 
 ##  context 
 In my research of software and hardware technology, I came up with meny diffrent thinghs and challenges because I had problems for the software part and, how to find the resources I needed. I well first talk about the software and that is the part that developed my skills for research that later helpde me in the technology part.

 ### Software
  For the software I found **NCRMP** or **National Coral Reef Monitoring Program**. NCRMP is a wedsite that allows users to see corals development over years around the world here is the link (https://ncrmp.coralreef.noaa.gov/). An other sofware I found was **Viscore** this software program tack underwater picher and videos of corels and make it into 3D high-resolution map of reef. with viscore researchers can "virtually" revisit dive sites and use the software to perform detailed analyses that would be time-consuming or impossible in person. I found all this informaton on (https://chei.ucsd.edu/the-software-thats-saving-corals/). Up next is **CPCe** or also knew as **Coral Point Count with Excel extensions**. This software is a Windows-based program that uses a "random point count" method to analyze photos of coral reefs to determine coral cover in other words this analyzes corals and then puts the corals development into graphs more information in link (https://hcas.nova.edu/tools-and-resources/cpce/index.html). Lastly we have **CoralXDS** or **Coral X-radiograph Densitometry System**. CoralXDS is a Windows program that analyzes coral X-ray images to measure growth by examining high-density, low-density, and annual bands link i use was https://hcas.nova.edu/tools-and-resources/coralxds/index.html.   
 
### Technology
  For technologie found **Bird-eye view** though not created for corals researchers in the field of coral watching had stard using it so that they could have an opportunity to observe corals from their homes. I works by useing a sensing technology that detect changes in coral environment all information in article (The Shift to a Bird's-Eye View: Remote sensing technologeis allow researchers to track small changes on a large scale and enable studies of far-flung places from the comfort and safety of home). An nother example is the cameras use artificial intelligence (AI) to remotely track the growth and survival of coral larvae and babies in tanks and nurseries (https://www.barrierreef.org/news/news/five-spawning-technologies). **Mineral accretion** is a technology that uses utilizes low voltage electricity to inprove the groth of corals by allowing minerals in the water to fall out of the water and accumulate onto the structure. These minerals are the same that corals use to grow thier skeleton so it help the corals grow faster and stronger.Also making the coral more immune to disease outbreaks, and other disturbances (https://newheavenreefconservation.org/projects/mineral-accretion). Up next one of the most interesting **cloud brightening** the way this work is by a machine that shout out water like sprinklers in the surface of the ocean to cool off clouds so that under the water it can cool off decause golbal warming is one of the digges problems to corals (https://www.barrierreef.org/news/explainers/what-is-cloud-brightening).   
   

## skills 
 Skills I use were learing to learnd how to refrase the questino I was asking google like intede of  **what are technology that help corals ?**, I did get results but most of them were thing that had nothing to do with being electronically motorized so I decided to change my sruch to **Technology powerd by electricity that help colars reef ?**. With that I got detter resolts but still did not get enough info to get my research done so I chang it again to **5 Technology powerd by electricity that help colars reef ?** with this google gave my names. When I got the name I remember what Mr.Mueller told me that all I had to do in this case was to research more about the technologie I found. This help two of my skills provem solving and  how to get a more soecific way to ask quetions to google to undersatnd that google doesn't know what to give me if i don't tell it specific instructions.
