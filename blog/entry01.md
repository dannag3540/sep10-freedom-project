 For my sep 10 freedom-project I desaided to take the topick of Marine corals because I want to tell people about how inportan corals are for the ocien and how they are an indangerd species.As my back up project were Biolegy and Animals but the thing that made me go for marine corals was the artical https://www.epa.gov/coral-reefs/basic-information-about-coral-reefs this artical told me about everything I didÂ´t know about coral such that they are an animal and not a plant and that they are one of the most importan part of the ecosystem. 

 When scrolling on the internet I saw this vidio that told the audience all the thing they should know about corals in a funny way but that gave me a moment I told myself that I would try and do the same.This also connect to what I want when I was a 8 year old kid I alway wantde to help the world becouse I love animals.Now that I have the opportunity to spread awareness about an endangered species and get to not only teach other about corals but also learn more myself.I get to understan that they so much in the world that we still have to learn and take care of.I want to show that our ociens are more then watre and fish. So for this project I want to de show that you can make your deams come true it all in finding way to do what you want to tell the world in your wolrds.
